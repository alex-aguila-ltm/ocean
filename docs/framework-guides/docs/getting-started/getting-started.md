# ⚡️ Getting Started

This guide introduces you to the Ocean framework used to develop integrations for Port. It is a hands-on walkthrough that will help you build your first integration—a simplified version of the GitHub integration that ingests a configured list of organizations, their repositories, and pull requests

:::note Port's GitHub Integration
Please note that Port offers a fully featured [GitHub integration](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/). This is only a simplified version to help you understand the basics of developing an integration using the Ocean framework.
:::

By the end of this guide, you will have a working integration that you can run locally and test. You will be able to:

- Understand the structure of an Ocean integration
- Develop a simple integration using the Ocean framework
- Run and test your integration locally


## Requirements
This guide assumes you have Python 3.12 installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In addition, you should be familiar with the basics of Python programming and have a basic understanding of how to use the command line.


:::tip Source Code
You can find the source code for the integration in the [Developing An Integration repository on GitHub](https://github.com/port-labs/developing-an-integration)
