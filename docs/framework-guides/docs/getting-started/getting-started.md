# Getting Started

In this guide, you will learn the basics of the Ocean framework used to develop integrations for Port. This is a hands-on guide that will walk you through the process of developing your first integration. You will be building a version of the GitHub integration that ingests organizations (a configured list of organizations), their repositories and their pull requests.

At the end of this guide, you will have a working integration that can be run locally and tested, and you should be able to:

- Understand the structure of an Ocean integration
- Develop a simple integration using the Ocean framework
- Run and test your integration locally


## Requirements
This guide assumes you have Python 3.11 installed on your machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In addition, you should be familiar with the basics of Python programming and have a basic understanding of how to use the command line.


:::tip Source Code
You can find the source code for the integration in the [Developing An Integration repository on GitHub](https://github.com/port-labs/developing-an-integration)
