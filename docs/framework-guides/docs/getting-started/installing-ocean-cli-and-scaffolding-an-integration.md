# üöÄ Installing Ocean CLI and Scaffolding an Integration

In this part of the guide, you'll learn how to **install** the Ocean CLI and **scaffold** a new integration

## Requirements
You should have Python 3.11 installed on your machine as stated in the previous section. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setting up the environment
While integrations are usually developed within the [Ocean monorepo](https://github.com/port-labs/ocean/), you can also develop integrations standalone. If you plan to publish your integration to the Port catalog, you should develop it within the Ocean monorepo. Go to the [Monorepo development](#monorepo-development) section to learn how to set up the Ocean monorepo.

### Standalone Development
#### Installing the Ocean CLI
Run the following command to install the Ocean framework and its CLI tool:

```bash showLineNumbers
$ pip install "port-ocean[cli]"
```

Once this is done, verify the installation by running the following command, you should see an output with the version of the Ocean CLI:

```bash showLineNumbers
$ ocean version
üåä Ocean version: 0.18.9
```

#### Scaffolding Your Fist Integration
Next, you will scaffold the GitHub integration for ingesting Organizations, Repositories and Pull Requests. Run the following command to scaffold a new integration:

Here are your next steps:

‚öìÔ∏è Install necessary packages: Run cd ./github && make install && . .venv/bin/activate to install all required packages for your project.
‚öìÔ∏è Copy example env file: Run cp .env.example .env  and update your integration's configuration in the .env file.

### Monorepo Development

#### Cloning the Ocean Monorepo
To develop integrations within the Ocean monorepo, you need to fork the [Port Ocean monorepo](https://github.com/port-labs/ocean), clone it to your local machine, and install the dependencies from the root directory.

```bash showLineNumbers
$ make install
```

#### Scaffolding the project with `make new`
Next, you will scaffold the GitHub integration for ingesting Organizations, Repositories and Pull Requests. Run the following command to scaffold a new integration:

## Test to see if the integration is working
To test to see that the integration is working, we will initialize the environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` and updating the configuration in the `.env` file.

<summary><b>Setting up the environment variables (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```bash showLineNumbers
$ cd ./github # or cd ./integrations/github if you are in the monorepo
$ cp .env.example .env

Next, activate the virtual environment and run the integration:

Once you see the output above, the integration is running successfully. Stop it by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

Head over to your Port dashboard, click on `"Builder"` on the top right corner. Next click on `"Data Sources"` and you should see the GitHub integration you just created. Delete it by clicking on the three dots on the right side of the integration and selecting `"Delete"`. This is to ensure the integration starts on a fresh slate when you run it again.


## Integration Structure
The integration scaffold comes with the following structure which can be visualized with the `tree` command:


<details>

<summary><b>Integration structure (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```bash
$ tree

github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changelog # A directory containing automatically generated changelog files when the integration is ready to be published
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md    # A file containing the changelog of the integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md # A file containing the contributing guidelines for the integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug.py    # Entry point for debugging the integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py     # Entry point for the integration. This is where resync functions to export data to Port are defined
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile    # A file containing the commands to run the integration, it is a symlink to the Makefile in the Ocean library
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poetry.toml # Poetry configurations for the integration's virtual environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml      # Dependency and project metadata for the integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Description of the integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sonar-project.properties    # SonarQube configurations for the integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests       # A directory containing tests for the integration
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_sample.py
```

</details>


The `.port` directory contains configurations for the integration and is documented in detail in the [Integration Spec and Default page](../develop-an-integration/integration-spec-and-default-resources.md)

With this done, we will go ahead to implement an API client for the GitHub API to fetch organizations, repositories and pull requests.

#### Interactive API docs

An integration comes built-in with a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) server which also provides a REST interface and a Swagger webpage.

To view the routes exposed by your integration open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs). You will see the automatic interactive API documentation for the integration routes (provided by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)):

<summary>Alternative API docs</summary>

There is an alternative to the API docs (provided by [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc))

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc). You will see the following:

You can find the source code for the integration in the [Developing An Integration repository on GitHub](https://github.com/port-labs/developing-an-integration)
